# GNN from Scratch Using NumPy

## Overview

This project implements Graph Neural Networks (GNN) from scratch using PyTorch. GNNs are designed to process graph-structured data by learning node and edge representations, making them suitable for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph-level classification. 
The project explores key GNN concepts like message passing and aggregation to capture relationships within graph data effectively.

This project was built with the guidance of the tutorial [Graph Neural Networks](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial7/GNN_overview.html). 
The tutorial offers a detailed explanation of GNN theory and step-by-step code implementation using NumPy.

## Class Project

This project was developed as part of the Neural Network class under the instruction of [Professor Vignesh Narayanan](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/narayanan_vignesh.php) at the University of South Carolina.
